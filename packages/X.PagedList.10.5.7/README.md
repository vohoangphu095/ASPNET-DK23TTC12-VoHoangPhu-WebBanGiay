## What is this?
This is a fork of [Troy's](https://github.com/troygoode) project PagedList. The main difference is that X.PagedList is a library that supports the 
modern .NET platform â€” you can use it everywhere the .NET platform is supported.

This library enables you to easily take an IEnumerable/IQueryable, chop it up into "pages", and grab a specific "page" 
by an index. PagedList.Mvc allows you to take that "page" and display a pager control that has links like "Previous", 
"Next", etc.

## How to use
You can find all information about how to use X.PagedList libraries in [Wiki](https://github.com/dncuug/X.PagedList/wiki)
